A simple tool to order the daily breakfast and lunch at GSG bootcamp.
The original requirement:

> We always get food late and sometimes have no choice. The super app of Hani
didn't really work, let's help him. Build a website where everyday we can oder
breakfast and lunch. When visiting it the user should see a form with a time
deadline. Each order is saved on a Google Sheet and at a specific time, 10:00am
for breakfast and 02:00pm for lunch. The breakfast Orders will be sent to Hani1,
and the lunch Orders will be sent to Hani2 on the phone as an SMS.

## Run

In order to run the application you will need use Google and Twilio APIs.

To use Twilio just signup, while for Google you need to follow those steps:
- signup on Google
- visit the [google console](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/dashboard)
- on "Dashboard" click "Enable API", look for "Sheets", click on the result and "ENABLE"
- on "API Manager", select "Credentials" and click on "Create a project"
- on the modal enter the project name `Pasto` and submit
- click on "Create credentials" and select "Service account key"
- select "New service account", enter `bot` in "Service account name", role "Project > Editor"
- select JSON format for the key and click create
- go on [google sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/0/) and create one
- name it whatever you like and make sure to share with the `GOOGLE_CLIENT_EMAIL`

If all the steps about are correct, you should have downloaded the json keys and
create the sheet when the orders will be saved.

For Google SignIn instead:
- visit the [official docs](https://developers.google.com/identity/sign-in/web/sign-in)
- in the "Specify your app's client ID", click on highlighted section which should
  redirect to the google developer console
- follow the instructions on https://developers.google.com/identity/sign-in/web/devconsole-project

In order to run the application first create a `.env` file like the example. Note,
these are pseudo-random values and not real ones.
